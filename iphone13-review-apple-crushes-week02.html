        CHRISTMAS is nearly here – so that means it’s time for a new iPhone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been trying out Apple’s iPhone 13 ahead of the festive season to see if its up to scratch. Spoilers: It’s fabulous. Hey Siri, FaceTime Santa…

      </ul>
      <div>
        <p>
          There are four new iPhones this year: two regular models and two Pro versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to value for money, you’ll want the iPhone 13 Mini or iPhone 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          They start at $699/£679 and $799/$779 respectively – and that’s a £20 price cut versus last year for Brits.
        <p>
        <p>
          Both models are largely identical, so really you’re choosing screen size: 6.1 inches or 5.4 inches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mini, for me, is too small.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I’m a fan of the gargantuan 6.7-inch Pro Max, so that’s no surprise. For loads of people, the Mini will be the perfect fit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Both devices use Apple’s better-than-your-TV Super Retina HDR OLED screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s extremely colour accurate, and now 28% brighter – up to 800 nits, or 1,200 nits for HDR content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the device that surrounds the screen is also very attractive.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s the same premium squared-off design with a shiny rear, a slightly smaller “notch” jutting out onto the display, and a brand new colour option: Pink!
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, not much has changed. That’s fine. Why fix what isn’t broken?
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Power Up</h3>
      <p>
        Powering the iPhone 13 is Apple’s new A15 chip, which has 15billion transistors – tiny electronic switches that get computing done.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s seriously fast and the iPhone 13 absolutely flies. Tests suggest it destroys Android rivals. That’s amazing given the price.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chip has also paved the way for some hefty battery life improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the iPhone 13 Mini, you’ll get an extra 1.5 hours versus last year’s model.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that rises to an additional 2.5 hours for the iPhone 13 proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no charging block in the box but you still get a cable – and wireless charging is supported too.
      </p>
      <h3>Super Snapper</h3>
      <p>
        Probably the big news for everyday users is the camera improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The iPhone 13 is now significantly better in low-light, so your late-night snaps and selfies look way better.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s very noticeable and I’ve been increasingly impressed with how quickly the iPhone is improving on the low-light front.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s also sensor-shift optical image stabilisation to reduce image blur.
      </p>
      <p>
        And there are new Photographic Styles – special snapping presets created by Apple to make your photos look cooler.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’re entirely optional, but it’s an easy way to get a bit of flair by changing the contrast or colour tones of your photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cinematic Mode is the other big addition for video, letting you have a Hollywood-style depth of field.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it also offers a new features that shifts focus between two people in a video – just like in the movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s very easy to do, because the mode manages all of the work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you can even change the focuses after the video has been recorded, which is a nice trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and the iPhone 13 shoots in Dolby Vision HDR – very exciting on a phone that costs less than $700/£700.
      </p>
      <p>
        Impressively, the TrueDepth camera on the front has many of the same features on the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you’ll still get the Cinematic Mode, Apple’s new Photographic Styles, selfies in Night Mode and more.
      </p>
      <h3>All-round goodness</h3>
      <p>
        The real “sleeper” upgrade here is the fact that base storage on iPhone has now doubled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It used to be 64GB, but you’ll now get 128GB as standard – which is plenty for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like last year’s round of iPhones, the new models all support 5G internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        5G is getting faster and more widely available, so it’s a great time to upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might find your existing SIM already supports 5G anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least is the addition os iOS 15, Apple’s new iPhone software.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s got some neat tricks like a Focus mode that lets you shut out distractions from certain apps and messages, as well as Portrait Mode for FaceTime calls.
      </p>
      <h3>iPhone 13 review verdict – impossibly good</h3>
      <p>
        The iPhone 13 isn’t wildly different from the iPhone 12, but who upgrades their phone every year?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re coming from the iPhone 11 or older, there are huge upgrades to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you’re using something like an iPhone 8, the iPhone 13 is truly worlds apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        No iPhone is “cheap”, but the value for money on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini is extremely good when you compare it to Android rivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, this is a phone that just works – and works very well. That’s what you’re paying for, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sun says: Apple has refined an already-great iPhone into a truly exceptional mobile. For the price, it trumps any Android rival – and is very hard to fault. 5/5
